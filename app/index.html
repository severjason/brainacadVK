            The European Union needs a military headquarters to work towards a common military force, the Commission
            president has told MEPs in Strasbourg.
            Jean-Claude Juncker said the lack of a "permanent structure" resulted in money being wasted on missions.
            Part of his annual state of the union address was devoted to the UK's unexpected vote to leave the EU.
            He insisted that the bloc was not at risk and urged Brexit negotiations to take place as quickly as
            possible.
            The Brexit vote has given added impetus to plans for greater defence co-operation, because the UK has always
            objected to the potential conflict of interest with Nato.
            But Mr Juncker said a common military force "should be in complement to Nato". "More defence in Europe
            doesn't
            mean less transatlantic solidarity."
            <br/>
            A European Defence Fund would stimulate military research and development, he said.
            Brexit: All you need to know about the UK leaving the EU
            Brexit vote revives dream of EU army
            Why a military HQ? By BBC Defence correspondent Jonathan Marcus
            All EU members have military forces; most are also members of Nato; and several have extensive experience of
            operations abroad, from peace-keeping to war-fighting.
            The real question is how to organise these component parts to get greater security. Mr Juncker insists that
            the
            EU must have a role here.

            He wants to improve EU command and control facilities and appears to be suggesting that EU civil and
            military
            aspects of a given mission should be run out of the same headquarters.
            He also insists that whatever the EU does it should not detract from Nato. But defence resources are finite.
            His
            critics will say nothing should be done that duplicates existing Nato activities, as that sends a signal of
            disarray in Western ranks to Moscow.
            On Brexit, Mr Juncker warned that the UK could not expect selective "a la carte" access to the internal
            market
            without accepting free movement of people.
            The single market has dominated the Brexit debate in the UK.
            Prime Minister Theresa May distanced herself last week from remarks by Brexit minister David Davis, when he
            said
            remaining in the single market would be "very improbable" if it meant giving up control of British borders.

            Jean-Claude Juncker and his team agonised over the wording of Wednesday's speech.
            The UK's vote to leave the EU is undoubtedly one of the biggest crises the bloc has ever faced but Mr
            Juncker
            was determined not to dwell on it.

            Media captionJean-Claude Juncker: No "a la carte" access to EU internal market for UK
            There were few words on Brexit. His main message: "The European project continues. Let's choose to look
            forward.
            Be positive."
            <br/>
            Applause resounded around the chamber of the European Parliament but how will the voters outside react?
            Are they even listening? The drumbeat of nationalist, Eurosceptic populism reverberates around the
            continent.
            Public trust in the establishment is low - whether traditional politicians, bankers or EU bureaucrats - and
            Mr
            Juncker is an unelected president.
            The Commission president's state of the union speech - introduced in 2010 - is modelled on the annual speech
            by
            the US president and aims to report on the condition of the EU and outline a future legislative agenda.
            Mr Juncker admitted the EU was facing an "existential crisis", but he said it had to deliver "concrete
            results"
            in response, including:
            Maintaining stability and sharing the burden of economic downturn, such as doubling investment in the EU to
            €500bn (£425bn; $560bn) in the next five years and creating an investment fund for Africa
            Creating solidarity in the Union - such as protecting unaccompanied minors migrating to the EU - but Mr
            Juncker
            said this must "come from the heart" and could not "be forced or imposed"
            Promoting security including strengthening the EU's borders and promoting greater security co-operation
            between
            member states, as well as greater military centralisation.
            He urged a renewed focus on the EU as a "driving force that can bring about unification, for instance in
            Cyprus".
            <br/>
            Splits in the Union had left space for "galloping populism," he said, "and we cannot except that, as
            populism
            doesn't solve problems, on the contrary populism creates problems".
            In a blunt criticism of recent attacks on immigrants in the UK, he said he would "never accept Polish
            workers
            being beaten up, harassed or even murdered on the streets of Essex".
